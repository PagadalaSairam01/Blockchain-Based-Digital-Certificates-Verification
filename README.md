# Blockchain-Based-Digital-Certificates-Verification
This project implements a secure and decentralized certificate validation system using blockchain technology. It addresses the growing problem of certificate forgery by leveraging Ethereum-inspired blockchain architecture, cryptographic hashing (SHA-256), and a Python-based GUI to securely issue, store, and verify digital certificates.
