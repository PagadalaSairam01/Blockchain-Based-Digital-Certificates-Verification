# Blockchain-Based-Digital-Certificates-Verification
This project implements a secure and decentralized certificate validation system using blockchain technology. It addresses the growing problem of certificate forgery by leveraging Ethereum-inspired blockchain architecture, cryptographic hashing (SHA-256), and a Python-based GUI to securely issue, store, and verify digital certificates.<br>


<h2>Features</h2>
Blockchain-secured certificate storage<br>
Tamper-proof validation<br>
Smart contract-based transparent verification<br>
GUI for certificate upload and verification<br>
Python-based implementation<br>
Fast verification with no central authority dependency<br><br>

<h2>How It Works</h2><br>
<H2>Certificate Issuance</H2><br>
User inputs Roll No, Name, Contact<br>
Uploads certificate (PDF)<br>
SHA-256 digital signature is generated<br>
Block added to blockchain<br>
Ledger updated & saved locally<br>
<H2></H2>Certificate Verification</H2><br>
User uploads a certificate for verification<br>
System computes hash<br>
Hash is compared with blockchain records<br>
Displays "Verification Successful" or "Verification Failed"<br>

<h2>Technology Stack</h2><br>
Programming Language: Python 3.7<br>
Frameworks/Libraries: Tkinter, hashlib, pickle<br>
Blockchain Layer: Custom Python blockchain inspired by Ethereum architecture<br>
Hashing Algorithm: SHA-256<br>

<h2>Applications</h2>
Academic institutions<br>
Professional certification bodies<br>
Government ID and record systems<br>
Employment background verification<br>
Healthcare professional licensing<br>
Supply chain compliance certificates<br>

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2><br>
Migration to Ethereum testnet or mainnet<br>
Integration with QR-based verification<br>
Web dashboard and REST APIs<br>
Smart contract automation for certificate lifecycle<br>
Mobile application for real-time scanning and verification<br>
<h2>Project Outcome</h2><br>
The system successfully demonstrates how blockchain can modernize and secure the certificate ecosystem. It ensures authenticity, increases trust, and drastically reduces time spent on verification processes—making it suitable for educational, governmental, and enterprise-level implementations.<br>
